### Case to solve    
To write a code that guess a random number at minimum iterations.

**Competition conditions:**  
- Computer picks a random integer from 1 to 100 and our code have to guess. 
- Algoritm takes into account whether our try more or less than needed.

**Quality metric**     
The mean quantity of iterations from 1000 games is estimated.

**Practice**     
Practice a good python code.

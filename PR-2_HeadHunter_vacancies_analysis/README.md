### Case to solve    
Complete SQL requests to PostgreSQL database, deep into the tables structure, research some features and discuss results. 

**Jupyter notebook**  
Establish connection from python Jupyter notebook to PostgreSQL database.

**Preliminary data analysis**     
Take a look at database tables dimentions.

**Detailed vacancies analysis**     
Work with the vacancies table, group, count and order by columns.

**Employers analysis**  
Discover some data through tables join, get data from API.

**Subject analysis**  
Filter data, apply functions and conditions.
